# IMPROVE COCHLEAR IMPLANT SPEECH PERCEPTION
Jan2021- Under the guidance of Prof.Yahaswi Verma
The project is based on a research paper on how to improve cochlear implant speech perception using Neural Networks.
Various models have been discussed and implementation is done using feedforward neural network.
